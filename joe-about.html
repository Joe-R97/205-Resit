    <h1> Personal Statement</h1>
    <p id="aboutme"> As an <a>undergraduate from Coventry University</a>, studying towards a degree in <a>computing</a>, I have developed many programming skills as well as having a keen focus on web development. My academic work has enabled me to improve upon my problem solving and organisation. During my studies, I have undertaken contributions towards group projects, utilising and developing excellent communication and co-operations skills. Looking to eventually secure a position as a web or software developer, where I can make value of programming skills and develop them further. An alternative career option I have considered would be that of a data analyst, using my data and information retrieval skills learnt at university. </p>
